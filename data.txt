<p>The purpose of this Policy is to establish the scope of the risks that Klarna is exposed to, how Klarna manages them and respective areas of responsibility across the three lines of defense. This Policy sets out the roles and responsibilities for risk management, specifically the identification, assessment, management and monitoring of risks across the organization. 
</p><p>The objective of this Policy, and associated risk appetite approach, is to clearly set the desired risk culture and expected behaviors and capabilities in regards to risk management and the operation of a control environment that is suitable for Klarna’s size and complexity and enable sustainable growth over the long term. 
</p><p>The Policy will ensure that Klarna has a common, sound view of risk-taking based on an understanding of all risks to which Klarna may be exposed. It will also support how these are addressed and managed.
</p><p>This Policy forms the basis of Klarna’s group-wide risk management framework. It is supported by Klarna’s risk specific Policies and Instructions to provide an approach to how risks are identified and identified, assessed, managed and monitored.

<p>The ultimate responsibility for Klarna’s risk management rests with the Board, which establishes Klarna’s risk appetite and sets policies establishing the principles for Klarna’s Risk management. 
</p><p><b>First line of defense</b> refers to all risk management activities carried out by Leads and staff. All Leads are fully responsible for the risks, and the management of these, within their respective area of responsibility. Hence they are responsible for ensuring that the appropriate organization, procedures and support systems are implemented to ensure a sufficient system of internal controls and prudent segregation of duties. Leads&#160; are accountable for identifying and monitoring risks that occur within their area of accountability.  
</p><p><b>Second line of defense</b> refers to Risk Control (including Engineering Assurance) and Compliance. These functions set the principles and framework for risk management, facilitate and challenge risk assessments, perform independent control testing, and reporting of adherence to risk appetites, limits and frameworks. They shall also promote a sound risk management culture - and in this way enable the business - by challenging, supporting and educating staff. &#160;
</p><p><b>Third line of defense</b> refers to the Internal Audit function. They perform independent periodic reviews of the governance structure and the system of internal controls including risk strategy and risk appetite. These audits are both mandatory, from a regulatory perspective, or risk-based.

<p>Risk-taking is an essential element of Klarna’s business model but risks shall be kept within the Board agreed risk appetite to achieve Klarna’s strategic objectives and deliver on the forecast. 
</p><p>The purpose of risk management is to:
</p>
<ol><li>Protect Klarna’s long term survival</li>
<li>Manage volatility in the financial performance,</li>
<li>Promote operational resiliency and excellence, and</li>
<li>Enable informed decision making</li></ol>
<p>The strategies to manage risk should include transferring the risk to another party, avoiding the risk, mitigating the risk, accepting the risk or even increasing the risk if there are strong business arguments for this and Klarna remains with the Board approved risk appetite.
</p><p>Klarna's core activities are payment services, factoring services and low value consumer credits. All credits are linked to specific purchases of goods and services. Klarna never lends money, it only finances purchases. Hence each item on the balance sheet is connected to a specific purchase.

<p>Klarna’s approach to risk management is built around the core risk management cycle of identification, assessment, management and monitoring of risks. Klarna considers the causes, or drivers (e.g. process failure), of risks, the risk (e.g. external fraud) and the impact (e.g. financial, regulatory) to clearly articulate why a risk has occurred and its impact on the organization and its stakeholders. &#160; 
</p><p>A key control to manage risks is Policies and Instructions<span class="col-black">. Klarna’s governing document approach is defined in the <a href="/wiki/Creating_a_Great_Governing_Document_Routine" title="Creating a Great Governing Document Routine" data-bs-title="Creating_a_Great_Governing_Document_Routine">Creating a Great Governing Document Routine</a>, and in the</span> <span class="col-red"><a href="/wiki/Governance_(Category)" title="Governance (Category)" data-bs-title="Governance_(Category)">Governing documents</a></span> <span class="col-black">category</span>. The approaches for the identification, assessment, management and monitoring of all risk types and Level 1 risks in the risk taxonomy are outlined in the table below. Further supporting these are specific policies for Level 2 risks, such as Conduct or Financial Crime risk which are included as related governing documents in each Policy or Instruction. The owners of the underlying Policies and Instructions act as the coordinator of how the risk types are managed across Klarna. They act as a primary contact for regulator requests for different types of risks.

<p>Klarna shall have a risk culture that encourages informed decision making. Risk culture is critical to Klarna’s success. The key pillars of Klarna’s risk culture are:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Leadership and tone from the top</b> - as set out by Klarna Leads and CXOs promote risk awareness and informed decision making</li>
<li><b>Accountabilities</b> - clear ownership of problem spaces and risks arising within it as set out in Klarna’s ways of working</li>
<li><b>Values</b> - setting out how Klarna achieves its mission as defined in the leadership principles and <a href="/wiki/Code_of_Conduct" title="Code of Conduct" data-bs-title="Code_of_Conduct">Code of Conduct</a></li>
<li><b>Risk Capability</b> - that staff have the awareness and skills to manage their risks, supported through training and awareness approaches from first and second line teams</li>
<li><b>Incentives</b> - ensuring that rewards are aligned with risk management practices, such as set out in the <a href="/wiki/Remuneration_Policy" title="Remuneration Policy" data-bs-title="Remuneration_Policy">Remuneration Policy</a> &#160;</li></ul>
<p>The Board is accountable for&#160; the overseeing of a sound risk culture that promotes risk awareness and understanding of the specific risks and operating within the established risk appetite. The implementation of the culture and risk management activities is the responsibility of all CXOs and Leads. They are responsible for ensuring that the business complies with Internal and External Rules, that all staff have a good understanding of the rules applicable to Klarna, that identified deficiencies are reported to respective Control Functions and that necessary measures are taken in case of risks outside of Klarna’s risk appetite.
</p><p>This culture is led by the Group Management team and supported by mandatory and recommended risk management training. Training is delivered through Klarna’s Looop training portal. Additionally, on-demand communications and training are provided by Risk Control and other Control Functions to promote a risk culture.
</p><p>On an annual basis Klarna’s risk culture is assessed through an all staff Risk Survey. This assesses the dimensions of risk culture and is used to develop an action plan for identified improvement areas.
</p>

<p>Klarna takes an active approach to risk management, aligned with its long term sustainable growth strategy. Klarna carefully evaluates fundamental business risks, considering trade-offs (e.g. acceptance rates vs credit loss rates) and their implications as part of an integrated approach before making informed decisions to achieve its short and long term objectives. It has limited risk appetite for risks not directly associated with its core business model, and seeks to mitigate those risks (e.g. currency risk).  
</p><p>Management of these risks is through an industry standard three lines of defense model (with the business owning risk, the second line providing oversight, and internal audit performing assurance). This provides a clear framework for assigning and coordinating risk management responsibilities across the organization, with risk management integrated into both the forecasting process and ongoing business decisions, ensuring risks taken are appropriate and managed effectively. This framework is codified in our risk governance documents, including the Risk Policy.
</p><p>Klarna’s approach to risk management considers both financial and operational resilience as outcomes, in addition to customer impact/experience, Klarna’s reputation and regulatory compliance. Risk-related metrics, including risk appetite limits, recovery plan triggers and risk-specific indicators, are continuously monitored and reported on. These metrics provide valuable insights into each risk type that support proactive risk management and informed decision making by enabling forward-looking assessments of potential risk exposures, helping to anticipate and mitigate future risks.
</p><p>The sections below detail our main risk types (per Klarna’s <a href="/wiki/Risk_Taxonomy" title="Risk Taxonomy" data-bs-title="Risk_Taxonomy">Risk Taxonomy</a>), Klarna’s willingness to take those risks and how they are managed.

<p><span>Klarna’s consumer credit risk arises from offering short-term, predominantly interest-free credit that empowers consumers to manage their finances and spread costs. All consumer credit decisions are preceded by a credit assessment that relies on external and/or internal data to make an informed decision. When assuming credit risk, Klarna seeks to optimize the balance of growth of Klarna’s consumer base and volume against the profits or returns from credit granting, subject to applicable regulations, sustainability considerations and Klarna’s ethical values.</span> 
</p><p><span>Partner counterparty risk relates to the risk that Klarna suffers a loss as a result of a merchant or distribution partner defaulting. The risk exposure is driven by Potential Merchant Loss (PML), a contingent liability representing Klarna’s obligation to refund consumers for returns and unconsumed services in the event a partner defaults. Payment counterparty risk relates to the risk that Klarna suffers a loss as a result of a payment counterparty defaulting. The risk exposure is driven by short term receivables to payment processors used to acquire payments from consumers using primarily card and direct debit networks.</span> 
</p><p>Decisions to take partner, payment, and institutional counterparty risk are based on the strategic value provided by a partnership with a given counterparty. When assuming risk, Klarna performs a quantitative and qualitative credit assessment of each counterparty and has a low willingness to develop exposure towards counterparties with a higher risk of default

<p>With regard to consumer credit risk, Klarna builds relationships with consumers and is able to extend greater amounts of credit over time to consumers who are demonstrating strong repayment performance and who fall within defined credit worthiness criteria. Klarna is diligent in not over-extending credit; rather, Klarna ensures that they have the capacity to repay any Klarna obligations. An assessment of a consumer’s credit risk is always made and used as a basis for underwriting credit decisions, this assessment is based on a credit scoring model. 
</p><p>Any processes that handle risks in relation to credit shall, to the largest extent possible, be based on automated tools that consider the associated risks. Where processes cannot be fully automated, tools shall be developed to support manual tasks in a controlled way. Ongoing analysis shall be performed to validate that profitability from consumers supports the degree of credit risk assumed.
</p><p>In entering merchant or distribution partner relationships, Klarna utilizes contractual payment delays as a form of collateral which is often able to fully offset the counterparty exposure, resulting in limited net credit risk. Merchant partners who desire more favorable payment terms must have other contractual provisions implemented to allow future flexibility, such as the right for extended payment delays if the partner deteriorates financially. With regards to distribution partners, Klarna should ensure that there are contractual provisions making Klarna a third party beneficiary to customer refunds owed by submerchants.
</p><p>These partners are also subject to underwriting processes and are continuously monitored. Klarna shall not enter into new relationships with merchants that pose excessive risk to Klarna or who do not otherwise meet Klarna’s standards. Klarna shall take reasonable precautions to ensure that approved partners have the capacity to carry out their obligations. 
</p><p>Each payment processing and institutional counterparty is subject to underwriting processes and continuous monitoring. Exposures to payment and bank counterparties are managed by minimizing contractual pre-funding requirements to payment issuers, implementing favorable pay delay terms, collateralizing exposures, holding excess cash reserves at central banks and/or diversifying across counterparties. &#160;
</p><p>Klarna’s counterparty portfolio is managed through ensuring there are limits set on individual exposure as well as the aggregated exposure and concentration to different industry segments.

<p>Operational Risk exists across all of Klarna’s business processes. The ability to deliver Klarna’s services to both partners and consumers depends on the reliable&#160; performance of our processes, personnel, products and third party providers. Operational incidents/failures do occur, with the potential to cause significant harm to Klarna and its consumers. To manage operational risk, Klarna operates a robust operational risk management framework. &#160;
</p><p>Klarna has zero tolerance for entering into or maintaining business relationships where there is knowledge or suspicion that Klarna’s products or services are being used for money laundering or terrorist financing. In such cases, Klarna will immediately terminate the relationship and take appropriate action in accordance with regulatory requirements.

<p>Klarna adopts a structured approach to operational risk management, which includes identification, assessment, management and monitoring of risks. This&#160; core approach is outlined in the Operational Risk Policy and is supplemented with specific instructions and routines. 
</p><p>On an annual basis, products and services are identified and assessed to determine their criticality in the event of a disruption. Once a product/service is identified as critical, a business continuity plan to ensure continuation of services is developed and tested. All business critical products and services are required to complete the risk control self assessment (RCSA) process which identifies and assesses key risks based on Klarna’s control environment. The RCSA includes identifying further actions to mitigate risk exposures. 
</p><p>To ensure ongoing operational delivery, outside of business continuity, a mandatory Incident management process operates to consistently manage incidents and provides a structure to learn and improve from the incidents going forward. 
</p><p>A key driver of operational risk is uncontrolled or poorly managed major changes. To mitigate this, Klarna operates a change management approval process (the NPA process) to ensure major changes are understood and assessed for risks. Every major change completes a risk assessment to identify and assess the risks associated with the change, followed by implementation of mitigating actions or controls to manage the risks.

<p><span>Due to Klarna’s multi-currency business and different tenors of its assets and liabilities market risk is an inherent risk of the business. Both in terms of currency risk in Klarna’s earnings and equity and interest rate risk via mismatch of terms in assets and liabilities arising from longer duration of funding compared to credits granted to consumers. Market risk is not actively taken, and all significant open positions are hedged either naturally or with market based instruments.</span>

<p>Klarna does not seek market risk but it is a consequence of its business activities. Klarna does not have any speculative elements in its currency risk management and the use of financial instruments are clearly defined with regard to authorization and limitations. &#160;
</p><p>Klarna seeks to match lending in foreign currencies with a financial liability in the same currency and any mismatches may be hedged. Similarly, Klarna seeks to the greatest possible extent to match changes in interest rate on borrowings with any changes in interest rates on lending and other interest bearing assets, and any mismatches may be hedged. The liquidity pool is invested in high quality investment grade instruments issued by central banks, governments, and banks, mortgage institutes, or corporates, resulting in low credit spread risk.

<p>Klarna acknowledges inherent ICT and security risks, including cyber threats, as a part of its operation in a highly digital financial environment. However, these risks are mitigated to the lowest feasible level through a risk-conscious culture and a well-defined governance structure that prioritizes resilience, adaptability, and rapid response. Klarna operates within clearly defined risk appetites, applied both at aggregate and business segment levels, to ensure ICT and security risks are controlled and within acceptable boundaries. When appropriate, Klarna may accept, transfer, or mitigate risks if business opportunities align with strategic objectives and fall within the pre-set risk tolerances. Decisions involving potential risk exposure are rigorously reviewed against these tolerances, especially for any instances where taking additional risk could deliver a competitive advantage or improve operational efficiency.

<p>Klarna’s ICT and security risks are managed through a structured, multi-layered approach, integrating risk identification, mitigation, and continuous monitoring to ensure resilience. Routine assessments identify potential risks across critical systems, while key controls validated through independent audits like ISAE 3000 and 3402 and quarterly control testing strengthen the overall security posture. Klarna’s Security Operations Center (SOC) provides 24/7 monitoring, detecting and responding to incidents in real time. Access to sensitive systems is tightly controlled, with regular access reviews ensuring adherence to least-privilege principles. Klarna continuously monitors its ICT environment for emerging risks using advanced tools complemented by red teaming and threat-led penetration testing, to simulate and prepare for real-world attacks​​.&#160; Risk management updates are reported to the Board regularly, with clear accountability across all functions to keep risks within the Klarna’s defined appetite and ensure compliance with evolving regulatory standards.

<p>Business risk refers to the impact on Klarna’s ability to achieve its objectives, arising from strategic choices and execution, considering Klarna’s capital position, the business environment, and sustainability factors. When establishing its strategy, Klarna takes an integrated approach, considering its long-term financial interests, potential risks, and the capital required to manage those risks. This is done by ensuring the business strategy, risk strategy, risk appetite and capital planning are developed concurrently to allow each element to be taken into account by the others to produce a unified and coherent outcome. This enables the Board to make informed and comprehensive decisions considering all aspects of strategy, performance and risk. 
</p><p><span>Klarna’s current strategy remains long term sustainable growth. Klarna accepts a lower level of Environmental and Social risk compared to Governance risks due to the historical focus on the latter in banking regulations. As a result, Klarna’s risk management practices for Governance are more developed compared to the evolving Environmental and Social risk frameworks.</span>

<p>Klarna takes an agile approach to managing business risk, regularly reviewing strategic performance and adapting to new opportunities. This includes exploring new technologies or markets whilst leveraging Klarna’s core strengths, such as its unique product offering, global reach, brand and core gross profitability. As a part of the forecasting process, Risk Control reviews and, where appropriate, challenges assumptions and the achievability of forecasts, ensuring alignment with the Board agreed risk appetite. 
</p><p>Klarna manages sustainability risks by recognizing both prudential and non-prudential regulatory dimensions. For prudential regulation, sustainability risk, including ESG factors, is integrated into risk management practices such as the credit policy and stress testing scenarios. Non-prudential regulation involves collaboration across Klarna to assess external data and communications, including ESG reports and voluntary reporting initiatives.

<p>Leads are accountable for the monitoring of the risks that occur within their area of accountability. This includes creating appropriate monitoring for key risks, control operation and design and utilizing any tooling and monitoring provided by the Control Functions. 
</p><p>Any monitoring should include limits to enable the assessment of whether the risk is in line with appetite or target level. All limits should be agreed with the Lead who is accountable for the team. The relevant Control Function should review suitable limits, to ensure that the limit aligns with Klarna’s risk appetite.&#160; &#160; &#160;
